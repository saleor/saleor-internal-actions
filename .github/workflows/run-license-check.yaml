# This reusable workflow checks and summarizes licenses of the caller's repository.
#
# Works as follows:
#
# 1. It generates an SBOM using ./sbom-generator/action.yaml
#    (cdxgen + fetches licenses from NPM, PyPI, etc.)
# 2. It analyzes the SBOM using grant (./grant-license-checker/action.yaml)
# 3. It sends the summary as a pull request comment
#    (edits the comment if it already commented previously)
